# This configuration file provides the basic input for the Freshbooks to
# LEDES converter. Lines beginning with a # are comments.
#
# It is assumed that the Freshbooks invoice description includes the
# billing Timekeeper for that line immediately after a "]" and running
# until the first ":".
#
# The first non-comment line MUST be the tax-id of the firm. It may be
# followed by an optional comma and the amount above which an invoice
# generates a warning. The default is 20000 ($20,000).
#
# All subsequent lines should be CSV-like with the billing party name,
# id, role, and optional billing rate, e.g. "John Doe,1,PT,1000", and
# then on the following line "Jane Doe,2,AS" etc. as per LEDES requirement,
# "PT" is partner, "AS" is associate, "OC" is counsel, "LA" is  legal
# assistant and "OT" is other timekeeper. No other abbreviations will be
# accepted.
